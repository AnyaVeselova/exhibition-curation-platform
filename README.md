# Challenges
- `Managing a Large Collection of Images and Filters-`Displaying thousands of artworks from two museums posed a challenge. To optimize performance, I implemented lazy loading and pagination, ensuring smooth browsing without overwhelming the app. Filtering artworks by criteria such as type, artist, and time period was also complex, so I developed an efficient filtering system using Reactâ€™s state management for real-time updates.

- `Meeting a 4-Week Deadline-` Given the short 4-week timeline, I carefully planned and prioritized key features, focusing first on core functionality before refining the design and adding enhancements. The tight schedule required me to stay organized and work efficiently throughout development.
